I think a clever use of Open Source is reusing and adapting
code written by others.

I have taken code and ideas from the following projects:

Etomite    : the installer
Mantis     : custom fields, ldap authentication, lang_api, database class
Eventum    : some javascript
Dotproject : ideas for custom fields and database class
