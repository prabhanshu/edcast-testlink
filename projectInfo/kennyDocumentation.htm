  <li>Replacing the excel docs with a system that mainains similar functionality</li>
  <li>Replacing the word docs with a system that mainains similar functionality</li>
  <li>Web based system that is accessable from anywhere</li>
  <li>Better reporting mechanisms for testers, leads, and managers

  <li>More advanced Multi-user execution environment

  <li>Hasn&#8217;t really been tested in a real world environment (Bugs!)</li>
  <li>There has been concern that the team would be hesitent to take up a new

    being tracked. Should be</li>

  <li><strong>Kenny1_0 (April 2003) </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Inital version completed enough to demo for team</li>
      <li>tagged as kenny1_0 in CVS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name='orca' id="orca"></A><strong>OrcaPilot1_0 (May 2003) </strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Determined that the first version of Kenny good enough for production 
        use would be used by the Orca QA engineers </li>
      <li>tagged as orcapilot1_0 in CVS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>OrcaPilot1_5 (May - June 2003)</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Most likely bug fixes and feature requests</li>
  </ul>
  <li><a name='team' id="team"></a><strong>Team1_0 (June - July 2003.. Coincides 
    with the ending of the Tango 2.0 Project *if the tool is ready)</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This would be a really big release for project Kenny. It basically assumes 
      that at some point the entire team would &quot;abandon&quot; the spreadsheet 
      method of tracking for the web version. OrcaPilot1_0 and 1_5 should help 
      determine if we're ready for this step</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Team1_5 (June, July, August, September 2003)</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Most likely bug fixes and feature requests</li>
  </ul>
  <li><a name='env' id="env"></A><strong>Environment1_0 (Time Frame Not Clear)</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>This release would add the concept that every testcase can be run multiple 
      times for each build because there are many environments to take into consideration. 
      This release will be a really large change to the structure of Kenny if 
      and when I decide to do it and require a huge code overhull.. </li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong><a name='tcdb' id="tcdb"></A>TCDB (Time Frame Not Clear)</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>This is another huge release that probably won't come for a while. The 
        goal of this release would be to completely remove the concept of word 
        documents as our test case database. It would &quot;seemlessly&quot; interact 
        with the test case tracking functionality of Kenny</li>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Test Case Creation </strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>Large pieces of the product are broken down into components (ex: email, 
        calendar) 
        <ol>
          <li>Components represented as a folder in the test doc folder </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Each functional area of the component is broken down into a category 
        or test procedure (i.e. email!TP001_sendMail) 
        <ol>
          <li>Test prodcedures are represented as a word document in a component 
            folder</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Each category is broken down into many different test cases 
        <ol>
          <li>Test Cases are represented as rows in the word document</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Each test case can be grouped together as different types of testing 
        (ex: functional, boundry, error) 
        <ol>
          <li>The Orca team groups together tests using keys</li>
          <li>It's not clear Client/Server how this team groups tests </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Test Case Execution </strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>In order for engineering to state that they have confidence in the product 
        they created a &quot;determined&quot; amount of test cases must be executed 
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Determining execution</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li> Product Marketing 
                <ul>
                  <li>Generally Product marketing will determine the acceptable 
                    standards that a product must have before it is shipped</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Once the level of execution has been determined a &quot;team 
                lead&quot; will select which test cases will be executed during 
                the project lifetime. 
                <ul>
                  <li>These test cases are currently stored in an excel spreadsheet 
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Builds </strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>Different versions of software are released to QA at periodic times 
            during the &quot;software lifecycle&quot;. These versions are known 
            as builds</li>
          <li>Each build fixes bugs or adds enchancements to the current code 
            base.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Smoke test </strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>Smoke Tests are subsets of the general test base which are meant 
            to give the product a &quot;general&quot; limit of stability</li>
          <li>Smoke Tests are run at the release of every build</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong> Regression Testing </strong> 
        <ol>
          <li>After a sucessful smoketest a subset of the total regression testing 
            (determined in step 1) is run 
            <ul>
              <li>Each bug that is found during this process is filed in bugzilla</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On a subsequent build (one where the bug from the last step is fixed) 
            a QA member is in charge of verifying that the fix is valid 
            <ul>
              <li>This is done by running the set of steps used to find the bug 
                or a set of steps defined by the developer</li>
              <li>QA members are also supposed to &quot;test around&quot; the 
                area of the fix to make sure another bug wasn't created</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>After a bug is verified QA members must 
            <ul>
              <li>Add a new test case to the testcase documents (if none exist)</li>
              <li>Add the test case to the tracking doc (not sure if we do this 
                or not)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong> Final Acceptance Tests </strong> 
        <ol>
          <li>When the product is nearing its release date a set of builds known 
            as &quot;release candidates&quot; or (RC) as produced 
            <ul>
              <li>A subset of test cases known as the &quot;final acceptance tests&quot; 
                (or FAT) are run against each RC build to verify its quality </li>
              <li>The status of the FAT helps to determine if the final RC candidate 
                is ready to be &quot;shipped&quot;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

<p><font size="4">Current Implementation</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="4">Mysql</font> 
    <ol>
      <li>A MYSQL database is used as the backend of our project. It is a free 
        tool that has good documentation and is easily used<strong> 
        <!-- Add schema diagram -->
        </strong></li>
      <li>Using version X</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong> PHP</strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>PHP is the primary tool used to create the front end of Kenny. It is 
        a rapid web development tool that interfaces well with MYSQL</li>
      <li>Using version X</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft Word</strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>All of the current test cases are contained in microsoft word documents</li>
      <li>Each individual test case is a row in the document and each section 
        of the document (results, steps, title) is defined in a style</li>
      <li>The idea is to use the parsing tool (see #4) to get the information 
        out of these docs and into the database once and then migrate away from 
        this system</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Visual Basic</strong> 
    <ol>
      <li>In order to get the data from the test cases into the test case database 
        a parsing tool was needed</li>
      <li>Since Will Camp already created a parsing tool for the client/server 
        tests we decided to adapt his tool for use on the orca docs</li>
      <li>My thoughts are that this tool will no longer need to exist once kenny 
        is fully being utilized </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
