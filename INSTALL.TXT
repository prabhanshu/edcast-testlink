TestLink - a php based test management system
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Because:

1. I'm lazy
2. I don't think my writing english it's good

I've preferred to build this document, using as my source of inspiration
(this means copy the file and change it) the INSTALL file present in the
excelent Open Source Bugtracking System MANTIS.


INSTALLATION

The following details the basic steps for installation on any system.  
The instructions may seem unix-centric but should work fine on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes to install,
configure, and be using TestLink.


# --- Requirements ----------

* MySQL 4.1 and higher
* PHP 4.3.11 and higher
* a webserver

# --- Summary ---------------

1. Tranfer files
2. Uncompress files
3. Generate database tables
4. Edit configuration file
5. PHP File extensions
6. Login

******************************************************************************

This installation process has changed with release 1.6.0.a

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver using whatever method you like
best (ftp, scp, etc).  You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for
the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Winzip, Stuffit, and other programs should also be able to handle
decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something simpler like
'testlink'.  You will use the mv command to rename a directory (Windows users
substitute the "ren" command or use explorer).

mv <directoryname> testlink

If you are upgrading see the UPGRADING document.

3. Next we will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file.

From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/install/index.php

This page will walk through the following steps:
a) check basic parameters for the web server
b) prompt for the database type and location, and a database user/password 
pair. For installiion, an administrative user/password pair can also be 
provided. The operating user requires ALTER, SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE
privileges. For installation, INDEX, CREATE, DELETE, and DROP privileges are
also required.
c) create the database and tables.

* WARNING: A DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR level account is created.  
The account name and password are:
                                   admin / admin.  
Use this when you first login to TestLink. 
Immediately go to Manage and create at least one administrator level account.  
Immediately after that DISABLE or DELETE the admin account.  
You can recreate it but you should delete the account to prevent the 
cookie_string from being used to trick the package.  It would be even better 
to rename the account or delete it permanently.  REMEMBER: After setting up 
the package, REMOVE the default admin account.

d) write a basic "config_inc.php file to define the database.
e) perform some post installation checks on the system.

4. The next part involves configuring the installation to work with your
specific setup.
