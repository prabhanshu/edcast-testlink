<b>General:</b><br>

It is possible that users may not see a dropdown containing any test plans. In this situation all links (except lead enabled ones) will be unlinked. If you are in this situation you must contact a lead or admin to grant you the propper project rights or create a project for you.

<br><br><b>Test Case Execution:</b><br>

This section is where users can execute test cases, print test plans, and create new builds.

<br><br>Note: Everyone can execute and print test cases but only leads can create new builds

<br><br><b>Execution Status:</b><br>

This section is where users can track the results of their test case execution. Users with lead permissions may also set the priority/risk and ownership of categories and create testing milestones.

<br><br><b>Test Plan Management:</b><br>

This section, which is only lead accessible, allows users to administer test plans. Administering test plans involves creating/editing/deleting plans, adding/editing/deleting/updating test cases in plans, as well as defining who can see which plan.
