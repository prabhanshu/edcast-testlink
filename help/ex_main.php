<b>Executing Test Cases</b><br>

This page allows users to "execute" test cases. Execution itself is merely assigning a test case a result (pass,fail,blocked) against a build. There are two different flags that a user will see on the execution page.

<br><br><b>Updated Test Case:</b><br>

Users will see the American flag <img src='../icons/flag.gif'> if the original version of the test case (on the management side) has been updated. If users have the propper rights they can go to the update/delete test case page either through clicking on the test case number next to the flag or through the link on main page. 

<br><br>Note:It is not necessary for users to update test cases if there has been a change. They simply have the option of doing so if they wish.

<br><br><b>Deleted Test Case:</b><br>

Users will see the "x" symbol <img src='../icons/x-icon.gif'> if the original version of the test case (on the management side) has been deleted. If users have the propper rights they can go to the update/delete test case page either through clicking on the test case number next to the "x" or through the link on main page.
