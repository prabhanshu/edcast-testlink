1. Introduction
===============================================================

TestLink is a web based test management and test execution system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test 
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. These test plans 
allow team members to execute test cases and track test results 
dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. All of the source code 
behind TestLink is freely available for download via SourceForge 
at http://www.sourceforge.net If you are interested in contributing 
to the TestLink effort feel free to contact us.


2. Release notes
===============================================================

This is final and stable release and we recommend to update from older version.

New features within 1.8: see CHANGELOG file.


3. System Requirements
===============================================================

- reliable webserver: Apache(recommended), IIS
- PHP5 (5.2 is recommended)
- DBMS: MySQL 4.1 (and higher),Postgres 8.x ,MS-SQL 2000
    

4. Installation
===============================================================
The following details the basic steps for installation on any system.  
The instructions may seem unix-centric but should work fine on Windows systems.

Barring complications, it should take you about 10-20 minutes to install,
configure, and be using TestLink.

# --- Summary ---------------

1. Tranfer files
2. Uncompress files
3. Launch web based installer

1. First, transfer the file to your webserver using whatever method you like
best (ftp, scp, etc).  You will need to telnet/ssh into the server machine for
the next steps.

2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.
The usual command is (1 step):

	tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz>

OR  (2 steps):

	gunzip <filename.tar.gz>
	tar xvf <filename.tar>

Winzip, Stuffit, and other programs should also be able to handle
decompression of the archive.

At this point you may want to rename the directory to something simpler like
'testlink'.  You will use the mv command to rename a directory (Windows users
substitute the "ren" command or use explorer).

mv <directoryname> testlink

3. Launch web based installer
We will create the necessary database tables and a basic configuration
file.

From your web server, access http://yoursite/testlink/

and follow instructions.


5. Upgrade and Migration
===============================================================
When accessing Installer page you will found following options:

 - New Installation
 - Upgrade Database
 - Migration from 1.6.2 to 1.7.x
 - Migration from 1.7.2 (or greater) to 1.8.0 

 Steps
 - Make a Backup of yor current database.
 - Using  a NEW DIRECTORY (DO NOT OVERWRITE your old installation), do only 
   following steps from Install procedure:
                                           Tranfer files
                                           Uncompress files
 - Copy your old config_db.inc.php to NEW DIRECTORY.
 - Launch TestLink
 - TestLink will check Database version, and if some upgrade/migration is needed
   will launch automatically the installer.

 
 If you are updating a same major version (1.8.0 to 1.8.1) you need to use
 Upgrade Database.
 
 If you are using a different major version detailed in options, you need 
 to use the specific Migrations.
 
 If in some steps TestLink ask you for two databases, NEVER NEVER use same name from both.
 
 If you do not find nothing useful, post in forum
   
 Always before login, after an upgrade/migration clear browser cookies.

9. Code reuse   
===============================================================
We try to follow as much as possibile the following principle:

       Do not reinvent the wheel.
       
We use code, and documentation from other Open Source Systems (see CODE_REUSE document for details).
Installation details has been written using Mantis INSTALL document as a guide line (and doing some cut and paste ;) ).
